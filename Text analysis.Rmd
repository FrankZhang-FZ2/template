knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
txt <- read.delim("stranger drowning.txt", header = FALSE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(tidytext)
library(tidyverse)
library(textdata)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
txt %>%
unnest_tokens("Word", "V1")

txt_tidy <- txt %>%
  unnest_tokens("Word", "V1") %>%
  mutate(Word = str_replace(Word, "'s", ""))

txt_tidy <- txt %>%
  unnest_tokens("Word", "V1") %>%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = c("Word" = "word")) %>%
  #inner_join(get_sentiments("nrc"), by = c("Word" = "word"))%>%
  mutate(Word = str_replace(Word, "'s", ""))


word_frequency <- function(x, top = 10){
  
  x %>%
    
# We need a word count
  count(Word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  
# We want to create a factor from the word column with the levels showing the most frequent words as top level
# This is just for aestethic reasons, however, it helps make the point
  mutate(Word = factor(Word, levels = rev(unique(Word)))) %>% 
# We use the "top" variable defined in the function so we can decide how many words we want to use 
  top_n(top) %>%
    
# This will be useful later if we want to use a grouping variable and will do nothing if we don't  
  ungroup() %>%
  
# The graph itself
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Word, y = n)) +
  geom_col(show.legend = FALSE) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL)
}

txt_tidy %>%
word_frequency(30)

count_txt <- txt_tidy %>%
count(Word, sort = TRUE)

count_sentiment <- txt_tidy %>%
  count(sentiment, sort = TRUE)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
